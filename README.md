You rush out of your house in a hurry, hastily grabbing the car keys and shoving your handbag into the passenger seat. Quickly, you reverse out of the garage and race toward the highway. The clock in the back of your brain ticks without mercy. Time goes on wether you like it or not. You're accelerating at the highest speed you can go when...SCREEECH. You launch your foot onto the brake. In front of you is the longest line of cars you've ever seen. Time is ticking. You look closer out the windsheild of your car and see a faint red light. Realization floods your brain. Maybe traffic lights aren't the best solution to road accidents?
